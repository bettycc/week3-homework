More than one million people visit its observation deck each year, making it one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations.

The Willis Tower is the second-tallest building in the United States and the 12th-tallest in the world. More than one million people visit its observation deck each year, making it one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations. The structure was renamed in 2009 by the Willis Group as part of its lease on a portion of the tower's space.\n\nAs of December 2013, the building's largest tenant is United Airlines, which moved its corporate headquarters from the United Building at 77 West Wacker Drive in 2012 and today occupies around 20 floors with its headquarters and operations center."], ["photo_url", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Sears_Tower_ss.jpg"], ["title", "Willis Tower"]]
